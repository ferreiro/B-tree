# B-tree
### Work in progress

Implement on Java or C++ a B-tree with the following operations:
- Insert Key.
- Delete Key.
- Query for a Key.

The size of node, must be a "n" parameter provied as a constructor of B-tree.
I'm using as a reference the Chapter 18 of "Introduction to Algorithms - Third Edition" from Cormem
